=================================================================

In order to use all of the features of this package you must have an active subscription with listwisehq.

This packaged was developed during my employment with Kennedy Marketing Group.
Thanks to them for giving me permission to open-source this.

- listwise enables users to easily clean email addresses via the ListWise REST API.
- Email addresses are pre-cleaned to remove the obviously invalid.
- All responses are stored in a sqlite database file and can be reused by future requests.

Installation
------------

pip install listwise

Connecting to the API
---------------------

listw = listwise.ListWise("C:/listwise_data.db", username, api_key)


One-off email validation
------------------------

::
    email = 'zekebarge@gmail.com'
    
    deep_cleaned = listw.deep_clean_one(email)
    
    quick_cleaned = listw.quick_clean_one(email)
    
    listw.db.con.commit() #To commit your updates to the database


Bulk e-mail validation using Pandas
-----------------------------------
::

    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_csv("C:/path/to/file.csv")
    
    #All updates are automatically committed to SQLite.
    
    deep_cleaned_df = listw.deep_clean_frame(df)
    
    quick_cleaned_df = listw.quick_clean_frame(df)
